#= Day 5

Today we have a blocked text file that is a list of maps.

We need to take each block out and store it as a map. Each map line
has rules for the format: X Y z

- X: the destination range start
- Y: the source range start
- z: range length

so that Y to Y+z-1 maps to X to X+z-1.

Eg, in the test seed-to-soil map we have:
`50 98 2`
which maps seeds 98-99 to soils 50-51
=#

# Part 1
# We're going to need to parse this file as blocks and make some
# parser assumptions.
# Assumptions: L1 will be seeds and we can parse this into our designation map
